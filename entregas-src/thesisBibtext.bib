  title = {Layered Learning in Multiagent Systems: {A} Winning Approach to Robotic

  publisher = {MIT Press},
  year = {2000},
  author = {Peter Stone},
  abstract = { This book looks at multiagent systems that consist of teams of autonomous
	agents acting in real-time, noisy, collaborative, and adversarial
	environments. The book makes four main contributions to the fields
	of machine learning and multiagent systems. First, it describes an
	architecture within which a flexible team structure allows member
	agents to decompose a task into flexible roles and to switch roles
	while acting. Second, it presents layered learning, a general-purpose
	machine-learning method for complex domains in which learning a mapping
	directly from agents' sensors to their actuators is intractable with
	existing machine-learning methods. Third, the book introduces a new
	multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm--team-partitioned, opaque-transition
	reinforcement learning (TPOT-RL)--designed for domains in which agents
	cannot necessarily observe the state-changes caused by other agents'
	actions. The final contribution is a fully functioning multiagent
	system that incorporates learning in a real-time, noisy domain with
	teammates and adversaries--a computer-simulated robotic soccer team.
	Peter Stone's work is the basis for the CMUnited Robotic Soccer Team,
	which has dominated recent RoboCup competitions. RoboCup not only
	helps roboticists to prove their theories in a realistic situation,
	but has drawn considerable public and professional attention to the
	field of intelligent robotics. The CMUnited team won the 1999 Stockholm
	simulator competition, outscoring its opponents by the rather impressive
	cumulative score of 110-0. },

  abstract = { Multi-agent domains consisting of teams of agents that need to collaborate
	in an adversarial environment offer challenging research opportunities.
	In this article, we introduce periodic team synchronization (PTS)
	domains as time-critical environments in which agents act autonomously
	with low communication, but in which they can periodically synchronize
	in a full-communication setting. The two main contributions of this
	article are a flexible team agent structure and a method for inter-agent
	communication in domains with unreliable, single-channel, low-bandwidth
	communication. First, the novel team agent structure allows agents
	to capture and reason about team agreements. We achieve collaboration
	between agents through the introduction of formations. A formation
	decomposes the task space defining a set of roles. Homogeneous agents
	can flexibly switch roles within formations, and agents can change
	formations dynamically, according to pre-defined triggers to be evaluated
	at run-time. This flexibility increases the performance of the overall
	team. Our teamwork structure further includes pre-planning for frequent
	situations. Second, the novel communication method is designed for
	use during the low-communication periods in PTS domains. It overcomes
	the obstacles to inter-agent communication in multi-agent environments
	with unreliable, high-cost, low-bandwidth communication. We fully
	implemented both the flexible teamwork structure and the communication
	method in the domain of simulated robotic soccer, and conducted controlled
	empirical experiments to verify their effectiveness. In addition,
	our simulator team made it to the semi-finals of the RoboCup-97 competition,
	in which 29 teams participated. It achieved a total score of 67--9
	over six different games, and successfully demonstrated its flexible
	teamwork structure and inter-agent communication. },
